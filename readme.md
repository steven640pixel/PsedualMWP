#Pseudo-Dual Learning for Math Word Problem Solving The code is the implementation of PseDual, we take the tree decoder framework as an exmaple.## PrerequisitesYou may need a machine with Titan V GPU and Pytorch v1.6.0 for Python 3.1. Install Pytorch with CUDA and Python 3.62. Install Transformers Pre-trained bert-base model for problems encoding can be downloaded to a ./pretrained_models directory.##DataMath23k and MathQA datasets can be downloaded from public sources and set to ./data directory. The annotations include problem tokens, expression, num_list and nums position inproblem.##Training and TestThe main.py script should be used to train and test the PseDual model. The models.py is the script that construct the model. * Train the solving module and infilling module jointly by using the following command and set arg to train.          python main.py+ Test the model setting args.test to ture and the trained models can be downloaded from the below anonymous links: https://anonfiles.com/7934oct3z9/model_rar
